### 564. Find the Closest Palindrome

Given a string n representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return the smaller one.

The closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers.

## Examples

#### Example 1

**Input:**

```
Input: n = "123"
```
**Output:**
```
Output: "121"
```

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
Input: n = "1"
```
**Output:**
```
Output: "0"
```
**Explanation**: 0 and 2 are the closest palindromes but we return the smallest which is 0.
